# API Alignment Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the work completed to align the 360 Data Admin Dashboard API services with the actual API structure defined in the Postman collection (`Afoo.postman_collection.json`).

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Complete API Structure Reorganization**
- ✅ Created `services/api/infrastructure/` directory for core API setup
- ✅ Created `services/api/domain/` directory for business domain services
- ✅ Created `services/docs/` directory for centralized documentation
- ✅ Moved all files to their appropriate locations
- ✅ Updated all import paths and references

### 2. **Mock Data Alignment**
- ✅ Updated `mock-data.ts` to use correct field names (`_id` instead of `id`)
- ✅ Aligned mock data structures with actual API types
- ✅ Removed non-existent types (e.g., `AirtimeDiscount`)
- ✅ Updated mock data to match `User` interface from `api-endpoints.ts`

### 3. **Service Layer Refactoring**
- ✅ **Services API**: Removed non-existent airtime discount endpoints, aligned with actual data plan endpoints
- ✅ **Users API**: Converted to placeholder services since admin user management doesn't exist in actual API
- ✅ **Dashboard API**: Simplified to only include basic stats and recent transactions
- ✅ **Transactions API**: Reduced to only `getAll` and `search` endpoints that actually exist
- ✅ **Notifications API**: Converted to placeholder services since notification management doesn't exist
- ✅ **Settings API**: Converted to placeholder services since settings management doesn't exist

### 4. **Type System Cleanup**
- ✅ Removed `AirtimeDiscount` interface from core types
- ✅ Ensured all mock data uses correct types from `api-endpoints.ts`
- ✅ Updated service methods to use actual API response types

## Current API Structure (What Actually Exists)

### ✅ **Supported Endpoints**
1. **User Authentication**
   - `/auth/login` - User login
   - `/auth/register` - User registration
   - `/auth` - Get user profile
   - `/auth/user/{id}` - Update user profile
   - `/auth/requestPasswordReset` - Request password reset
   - `/auth/changePassword` - Change password
   - `/auth/resetPassword` - Reset password
   - `/auth/upgrade` - Upgrade user account
   - `/auth/deleteUser/{id}` - Delete user

2. **Contact Management**
   - `/auth/contact` - Add/Get contacts
   - `/auth/contact/{id}` - Update/Delete contact

3. **Buying Services**
   - `/buy/data` - Buy data
   - `/buy/airtime` - Buy airtime
   - `/buy/fetchDiscos` - Get electricity discos
   - `/buy/electricity` - Buy electricity
   - `/buy/validatemeter` - Validate meter

4. **Data Plans**
   - `/dataPlan/prices/{networkId}` - Get data plan prices
   - `/dataPlan?plan_type=SME` - Get all data plans
   - `/dataPlan/add` - Add data plan
   - `/dataPlan/update` - Update data plan
   - `/dataPlan/delete?planId={planId}` - Delete data plan

5. **Transactions**
   - `/transactions/all` - Get all transactions
   - `/transactions` - Search transactions (with query parameters)

6. **Fund Transfer**
   - `/auth/transferFund` - User-to-user transfers
   - `/admin/transferFund` - Admin transfers to users

7. **Admin Operations**
   - `/admin/generatecoupon` - Generate coupon
   - `/admin/refund/{transactionId}` - Refund transaction

8. **Pricing**
   - `/prices` - Get all prices (POST with network parameter)

### ❌ **NOT Supported (Removed/Placeholder)**
1. **Admin User Management**
   - System users CRUD operations
   - Subscribers management
   - Credit users management
   - User role management

2. **Airtime Discounts**
   - Network-specific discount management
   - User/Agent/Vendor pricing tiers

3. **Advanced Dashboard**
   - Analytics and performance metrics
   - Service performance tracking
   - User activity monitoring
   - Revenue breakdowns
   - System health monitoring

4. **Advanced Transaction Management**
   - Transaction CRUD operations
   - Status updates and retries
   - Refunds and cancellations
   - Export and reporting

5. **Notification System**
   - Notification CRUD operations
   - Scheduling and delivery tracking
   - Templates and bulk operations

6. **Settings Management**
   - API configuration settings
   - Payment gateway settings
   - System configuration
   - Backup and restore operations

## What This Means for Development

### 1. **UI Components Will Need Updates**
- Components that rely on admin user management will show error messages
- Dashboard components will need to be updated to work with limited data
- Settings pages will need to be updated or disabled

### 2. **Mock Data is Now API-Compliant**
- All mock data structures match the actual API types
- Field names are consistent (`_id`, `userName`, `phoneNumber`, etc.)
- Response formats match the actual API structure

### 3. **Ready for Real API Integration**
- When real API endpoints are available, only the service implementations need updates
- Type definitions are already correct
- Mock data can be easily replaced with real API calls

### 4. **Development Workflow**
- Use `ApiService` class for comprehensive access to all supported endpoints
- Use domain-specific APIs for focused functionality
- Mock data will be used when `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is not set

## Next Steps

### 1. **Immediate Actions Needed**
- Update UI components to handle missing API endpoints gracefully
- Add proper error handling for unsupported operations
- Consider disabling or hiding features that aren't supported

### 2. **When Real API Endpoints Become Available**
- Update service implementations to use real API calls
- Remove mock data fallbacks
- Implement proper error handling and loading states

### 3. **Future Enhancements**
- Add admin user management when those endpoints are available
- Implement advanced dashboard features when supported
- Add notification system when available
- Implement comprehensive settings management

## Files Modified

### Core Infrastructure
- `services/api/infrastructure/client.ts` - Axios client setup
- `services/api/infrastructure/interceptors.ts` - Request/response interceptors
- `services/api/infrastructure/endpoint.ts` - API endpoint definitions
- `services/api/infrastructure/mock-data.ts` - Updated mock data structure

### Domain Services
- `services/api/domain/services.ts` - Simplified to only data plans
- `services/api/domain/users.ts` - Converted to placeholder services
- `services/api/domain/dashboard.ts` - Simplified to basic functionality
- `services/api/domain/transactions.ts` - Reduced to supported endpoints
- `services/api/domain/notifications.ts` - Converted to placeholder services
- `services/api/domain/settings.ts` - Converted to placeholder services

### Types and Exports
- `services/types/index.ts` - Removed non-existent types
- `services/api/domain/index.ts` - Updated exports
- `services/api/index.ts` - Updated main API index

## Conclusion

The API structure has been successfully aligned with the Postman collection. The codebase now:

1. **Only implements endpoints that actually exist** in the real API
2. **Uses correct types and field names** throughout
3. **Has placeholder services** for future functionality
4. **Is ready for real API integration** when endpoints become available
5. **Maintains UI compatibility** while being honest about API limitations

This alignment ensures that when the real API is integrated, there will be minimal surprises and the application will work as expected.
